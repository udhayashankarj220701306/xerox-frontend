      Refund and Cancellation policy This refund and cancellation policy
      outlines how you can cancel or seek a refund for a product / service that
      you have purchased through the Platform. Under this policy: Cancellations
      will only be considered if the request is made 1 days of placing the
      order. However, cancellation requests may not be entertained if the orders
      have been communicated to such sellers / merchant(s) listed on the
      Platform and they have initiated the process of shipping them, or the
      product is out for delivery. In such an event, you may choose to reject
      the product at the doorstep. J UDHAYASHANKAR does not accept cancellation
      requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. However, the
      refund / replacement can be made if the user establishes that the quality
      of the product delivered is not good. In case of receipt of damaged or
      defective items, please report to our customer service team. The request
      would be entertained once the seller/ merchant listed on the Platform, has
      checked and determined the same at its own end. This should be reported
      within 1 days of receipt of products. In case you feel that the product
      received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must
      bring it to the notice of our customer service within 1 days of receiving
      the product. The customer service team after looking into your complaint
      will take an appropriate decision. In case of complaints regarding the
      products that come with a warranty from the manufacturers, please refer
      the issue to them. In case of any refunds approved by J UDHAYASHANKAR, it
      will take 7 days for the refund to be processed to you.
